# Export indirection

Export indirection is a pure-WASM mechansim for instrumentation to apply resource charges for
invocations of exported and table functions before these functions are invoked. Consider the
following motivating example:

```wast
(module
  (func (export "main") (local i32 i32 i32 i32 i32))
)
```

If an embedder were to externally invoke `main` of this module without any special handling, the
resources required to initialize and store the local variables, as well as for the invocation of
the function itself would remain unaccounted for.

This problem could be solved by implementing the necessary accounting in the embedder, or by having
the embedder expose hooks enabling execution of code before a Host-VM entry. However, where it is
not be feasible to do so, export indirection can serve as a reasonable alternative.

With export indirection the accounting is approximated by introducing a trampoline function for all
exported functions and table elements. This trampoline is then able to execute the necessary
accounting routines before transferring the control flow to the original function.

```wast
(assert_instrumented (module
  (; ... ;)

  (func $main (local i32 i32 i32 i32 i32)
    (call $stack (i32.const -6))
  )
  (func (export "main")
    (call $stack (i32.const 6))
    (call $gas (i64.const 6))
    (call $main) (; alternatively, return_call ;)
  )
))
```

This wrapper function must have the same function signature as the indirected function and not
allocate any additional space for locals. If possible, prefer calling the original function using
the `return_call` instruction.

WebAssembly function definitions which are directly calling the function definitions affected by
indirection should continue directly calling the original function definition and account for the
resources of these calls the usual way.

Export indirection must not be applied more than once for a given function definition.

## Alternatives

It is not strictly required for an implementation to utilize export indirection to implement
accounting for the exported functions and table elements, if an equivalent form of accounting can
be implemented by other means. This mechanism is intended to be transparent, unobservable from the
hostâ€™s perspective.
